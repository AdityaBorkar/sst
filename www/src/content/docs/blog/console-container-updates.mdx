We are rolling out some updates to the [Console](/docs/console) to better support container applications.

### Logs

You can now see logs from your containers in the Console. In addition to the logs from your functions.

### Autodeploy

The Console can auto-deploy your apps when you _git push_ to your GitHub repo. We added the following updates recently.

- **VPC**: You can now configure Autodeploy to run in your VPC. This is useful if your builds need to access private resources.
- **Caching**: You can now configure files or directories to be cached as a part of your build process. This can help speed up builds.
- **Extended timeouts**: Autodeploys now have a maximum timeout of 36 hours. This is useful for apps that take a long time to build.
- **New runner sizes**: There are new `xlarge` and `2xlarge` sizes with around 70GB and 145GB of memory; helpful for large applications.

### Other updates

While not strictly related to containers we also added support for:

- **Manual deploys**: You can now manually trigger a deployment through the Console by passing in a Git ref and the stage you want to deploy to.
- **Redeploys**: You can now redeploy any past deploy through the Console.
- **Cancel deploys**: You can also cancel a deploy that's in progress through the Console.

### About Autodeploy

If you haven't used Autodeploy before, we designed it to be a better fit for SST apps when compared to alternatives like GitHub Actions or CircleCI.

1. **Easy to get started**
   - Autodeploy supports the standard branch and PR workflow out of the box. You don't need a config file to get started.
   - There are no complicated steps in configuring your AWS credentials; since your AWS account is already connected to the Console.
2. **Configurable**
   - You can configure how Autodeploy works directly through your `sst.config.ts`.
   - It's typesafe and the callbacks let you customize how to respond to incoming git events.
3. **Runs in your AWS account**
   - The builds are run in your AWS account.
   - It can also be configured to run in your VPC. This is useful if your builds need to access private resources.
4. **Integrates with the Console**
   - You can see which resources were updated in a deploy.
   - Your resource updates will also show you the related git commit.
